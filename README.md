# Fabric-Optimizer

I started sewing masks amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, for my non-profit business mad's masks (madsmasks.blogspot.com).  This is a snippet of code I wrote to help me figure out how many masks I can get out of a single piece of fabric.

It's not super efficient, because it only works for rectangular pieces of fabric being cut to the size of mask I typically make.  But maybe someday I'll add functionality to make it more versatile for other sewing projects.
